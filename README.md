The scripts mainly used are:

final.py: Train and test using all the classifiers and draw confusion matrices
and other figures showing comparison of the performances.

rf.py: Find best parameters of random forest classifier
and plot feature importance figure

adaboost.py: Find best parameters of adaboost classifier and
plot the relationship between error rate on the testing data and number of
trees.

main.m: Find best parameters of SVM classifiers and test on testing data.

To run the python scripts, these python libraries must be installed:
1. scikit-learn
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. pylab

Then you should be able to run the python and matlab scripts directly without
any parameters.
